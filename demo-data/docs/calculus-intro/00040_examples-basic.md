# Basic Examples: Computing Derivatives

Now that we know the power rule, let's practice computing derivatives of polynomial functions.

## Example 1: Simple Polynomial

Find the derivative of $f(x) = x^4$

**Solution:**
$$f'(x) = 4x^3$$

## Example 2: Polynomial with Coefficient

Find the derivative of $g(x) = 5x^3$

**Solution:**
Constants multiply through, so:
$$g'(x) = 5 \cdot 3x^2 = 15x^2$$

## Example 3: Multiple Terms

Find the derivative of $h(x) = 3x^5 - 2x^3 + 7x$

**Solution:**
Take the derivative of each term separately:
$$h'(x) = 3(5x^4) - 2(3x^2) + 7(1)$$
$$h'(x) = 15x^4 - 6x^2 + 7$$

## Example 4: Mixed Exponents

Find the derivative of $p(x) = x^6 - 4x^2 + 8$

**Solution:**
$$p'(x) = 6x^5 - 8x + 0 = 6x^5 - 8x$$

Note: The derivative of a constant is always zero!

## Example 5: Evaluating at a Point

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5$, find $f'(2)$

**Solution:**
First find the derivative:
$$f'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x$$

Then substitute $x = 2$:
$$f'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 4(2) = 12 - 8 = 4$$

This means the slope of the tangent line to $f(x)$ at $x = 2$ is **4**.
