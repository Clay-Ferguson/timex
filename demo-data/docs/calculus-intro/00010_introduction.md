# Introduction to Derivatives

Calculus is one of the most powerful mathematical tools ever developed, and at its heart lies the concept of the **derivative**. The derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes—in other words, it tells us the **rate of change**.

## Intuitive Understanding

Imagine you're driving a car and your position along a highway is described by some function $s(t)$, where $t$ represents time. The derivative $s'(t)$ tells you your **velocity**—how fast your position is changing at any given moment.

Similarly, if we have any function $f(x)$, the derivative $f'(x)$ tells us:
- How steeply the function is rising or falling
- The slope of the tangent line at any point
- The instantaneous rate of change

## Why Derivatives Matter

Derivatives are everywhere in the real world:
- **Physics**: velocity and acceleration
- **Economics**: marginal cost and revenue
- **Biology**: population growth rates
- **Engineering**: optimization of designs

In this introduction, we'll explore the formal definition of derivatives, learn the fundamental rules for computing them, and see how to apply these concepts to solve real problems.
